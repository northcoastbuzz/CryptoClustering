# CryptoClustering

## Overview

This notebook provides a detailed analysis of cryptocurrency price changes using data clustering techniques. It aims to explore patterns and groupings in the fluctuations of cryptocurrency prices over different time periods.

## Features

- **Data Loading:** Load cryptocurrency market data.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize the data using `StandardScaler`.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Generate summary statistics to understand the data distribution.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Apply clustering techniques like K-Means and PCA to identify patterns in cryptocurrency price changes.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn for applying standard scaling and clustering algorithms.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed or use Google Colab to open the `.ipynb` file.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```text
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to view the analysis.

## Data
